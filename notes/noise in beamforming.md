# Concept Note: Noise in Beamforming

- **Speckles** create a significant amount of noise
- [Side Lobes](<side lobes.md>) are also decreasing image quality

## Speckles
Each tissue boundary in the body will act as a scatter. The speckles come from these many scatters, and will contribute a lot of noise into the signal from the *large scattering boundaries*. 
- Compound imaging is a reliable way to minimize speckle influence onto image quality

## Side Lobes
Occur during beamforming. They are *secondary* peaks in the wave front that do not propagate into the desired direction.
