# Concept Note: PyBF (Python Beamformer)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a brief overview of the concept, highlighting its purpose and significance.-->
Library by Sergei [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Sergio5714/pybf/tree/master) to implement beamforming in python. There are 3 different algorithms available (Delay and Sum, two other) to reconstruct ultrasound images from B-mode raw data with $n$ transducers. 

## Key Features
<!-- Enumerate the key features or characteristics of the concept.-->

See [Structure of the repository](https://github.com/Sergio5714/pybf/tree/master#structure-of-the-repository) to get overview of the package:
- `pybf` contains low level routines
- `scripts`: here are the functions that implement even entire piple for image reconstruction
- `tests`: some testing functions to determine the quality and performance of the data/algorithms. There are tests that use the **PICMUS** dataset. IMPORTANT: put the folder `Picmus` into the pybf library, such that the path is `Beamforming/juypter/pybf/tests/data/Picmus`
