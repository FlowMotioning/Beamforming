## Git and GitHub

I found [this](https://medium.com/@jonathanmines/the-ultimate-github-collaboration-guide-df816e98fb67#:~:text=How%20to%20Collaborate%20on%20GitHub%201%20%20Step,Repeat.%20And%20that%E2%80%99s%20pretty%20much%20it%21%20See%20More.) short but nice rundown of how to collaborate using Git. 

# ToDo Section

- [ ] Understand beamforming
- [ ] Setup Project Roadmap
- [ ] Reconstructing Images from PICMUS dataset
    - [ ] substep
- [ ] Presentation

## Trello

I am currently working on taking this ToDo on trello, because Kanban is the better tool imo
